Amelia sat at her usual corner in the high school library, her fingers gliding over the canvas in front of her. She was lost in her own world, the swirls of paint matching the thoughts in her mind. It had been three years since Ryan left town, three years since their friendship had shattered into pieces, and yet, she hadn’t forgotten him. She hadn’t wanted to.

The door creaked open, and she glanced up, half-expecting the librarian or maybe a teacher. But it was Ryan. He walked in, not noticing her at first, and shuffled past the rows of books. He looked older, more confident, but there was a sadness in his eyes that hadn’t been there before.

She froze, heart racing. What was he doing here? He had moved away after that messy summer, and they never spoke again, not even through social media. She’d spent months questioning why he had left, why he didn’t try harder to stay in touch.

Ryan stopped in front of a shelf, then turned around and spotted her. A familiar warmth spread across his face, mixed with a nervousness she didn’t expect. He hesitated.

"Amelia," he said softly. His voice felt like a whisper from the past.

She felt her throat tighten but managed a nod. "Ryan. I didn’t expect to see you back."

He took a step toward her, running his hand through his hair. "Yeah, I didn’t either. I—I wasn’t sure I should. But I missed this town. I missed you."

She looked down at her canvas, unsure what to say. He had left without a word, without explanation. The hurt had built up over the years, a quiet resentment that had simmered in her heart.

“I’m sorry,” Ryan said, his voice cracking slightly. “I was an idiot. I should have never let things end the way they did.”

Amelia stared at him, the weight of those words settling in. It was the apology she had waited for, though part of her never thought it would come.

“I didn’t want you to leave,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ryan took another step closer. "I didn’t want to leave either. But my family… things were complicated. I just… didn’t know how to fix it. I didn’t know how to fix us.”

Amelia’s heart softened, but the hurt lingered. “So, what now?”

Ryan smiled faintly, his eyes searching hers. “Can we start over? Maybe this time, we can try not to screw it up.”

She bit her lip, considering the past and the future. It wasn’t going to be easy, but she had always loved the idea of second chances.

"Okay," she said finally, her heart cautiously opening. "We can try."
